## Run Steps To Test Local

1) Run Kafka (the folder where installed) <br>
  $ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
2) Run Zookeeper (the folder where Kafka installed)  <br>
  $ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
3) To check DB stored entries (Open Browser to view)  <br>
   http://localhost:8081/h2-console/login.jsp
4) To check implemented api from Swagger (Open Browser to view)  <br>
   http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs
5) To view implemented API document specs of Swagger from UI (Open Browser to view)  <br>
   http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html
